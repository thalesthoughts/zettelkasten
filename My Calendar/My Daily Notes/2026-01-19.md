## Reminders

> [!DANGER] Today's Highlight
> %% What am I most looking forward to today? %%
> Today ***officially*** marks the beginning of my Zettelkasten. This project is designed to be my “second brain,” a digital universe of notes and insights made up of small, interconnected entries that grow through links, references, and ideas collected over time. I’m creating it as a place to think out loud, to capture moments of curiosity, half-formed thoughts, and ideas that may not yet know where they are going. Rather than serving as a static archive, it’s meant to evolve alongside me, reflecting how my thinking changes, deepens, and occasionally doubles back on itself.
> 
> Inspired by the habits of great thinkers like Leonardo da Vinci, John Milton, John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Virginia Woolf, Mark Twain, C.S. Lewis, Marcus Aurelius, and others, I’ve come to realize that the journey of a polymath isn’t about knowing everything. It’s about staying open. It’s about curiosity, patience, and the willingness to sit with questions longer than answers. What draws me to these figures is not just what they knew, but how they paid attention, how they observed the world, and how they allowed ideas from different domains to inform one another.
> 
> This Zettelkasten is my attempt to practice that way of thinking. Each note is meant to stand on its own while remaining connected to others, forming a growing web of thought rather than a collection of isolated observations. Some ideas here will be tentative, incomplete, or even wrong. That’s intentional. I want this space to allow for experimentation, intellectual wandering, and the freedom to follow an idea simply because it feels interesting, without needing to justify where it leads.
> 
> In the coming days, I’ll spend time setting up the vault to suit my needs and workflow, shaping how notes connect and how ideas reference one another. During this period, I may not journal as frequently, and I don’t intend to write daily in the future. I want to protect the sense of enjoyment that comes from engaging with ideas on my own terms, without turning this into something driven by routine or obligation.
> 
> For the reader, this Zettelkasten is best approached as a living, unfinished space. It’s a record of curiosity in motion, a place where learning, reflection, and creativity intersect. It’s not merely about taking notes, but about cultivating a habit of attention and discovery, and allowing thinking itself to remain a deeply human, creative process.
