## Reminders

> [!DANGER] Today's Highlight
> %% What am I most looking forward to today? %%
> Today marks the second day of this digital commonplace book/Zettelkasten project. As I’ve mentioned in my previous daily note, my primary focus at the moment is setting up the rest of this vault, particularly the life design and productivity components, which means that I have to refrain from doing much journaling for the time being.
> 
> So far, I have made good progress and successfully set up the personal knowledge management part of the vault. However, I still need to refine the rest of my productivity workflow, particularly by integrating this Obsidian vault with third-party task management and time management services, such as Todoist and Google Calendar.
> 
> Admittedly, I want to spend a lot of my time refining my life design setup, particularly my life values, goals for 2026, and the different life spheres I want to focus my time and energy on, including projects and goals. It is really important to reflect on my values and priorities if I want this setup to be truly meaningful and, in turn, motivate and inspire me to engage with this system on a daily, consistent basis.
> 
> I anticipate this whole setup process will take up most of my time for the rest of the week, and what I could otherwise get done in a couple of days will take longer because I don’t have much time outside of school and work this week. However, I will try to get it done by either Friday or Sunday later this week, most likely Sunday.
> 
> Moreover, I need to allocate some time to establish my technology, programming, and development workflow needs. Alongside setting up this vault, I have been configuring my development workflow in my terminal, which I plan to push to Git along with this vault for version control.
> 
> With that being said, I will refrain from journaling like this until my vault is set up and ready to go, and with that in mind, I’m ready to dive into the rest of the tasks associated with this vault setup!
