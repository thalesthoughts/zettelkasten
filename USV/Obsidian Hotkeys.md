If you want to change a hotkey but don't know the name of it, the hotkeys settings page lets you find a hotkey based on the keystrokes.

Whenever you find friction in doing something or are doing something frequently, try to consider whether you want to make a hotkey for it to make it easier (ex. opening a specific pane on the [[Obsidian Layout#Sidebars]])

> [!TIP] Train yourself
> When you run a command with [[Command Palette]] that has a hotkey, train yourself to close the palette and use the hotkey instead.
> If you find it hard to stick, you can consider changing the hotkey to something that is more accessible or makes more sense to you 😊
