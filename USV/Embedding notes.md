## Principles

Instead of having two copies of the same text, you can embed a note or parts of it into another note.

To embed a note, add `!` before the link, like `![[🏠 My Home]]`, which shows the following:

![[My Home]]

### Embed Parts
To embed only a header of a note, add a `#` after the title of the note in the link and it will give you all possible options

To embed only a section, add a `^` instead

You can also copy these parts by selecting the desired text, right-clicking, and choosing `Copy block embed`
