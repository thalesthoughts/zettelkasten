> [!INFO]
> This is in the `Hidden` folders so all the tasks do not show up in [[My Tasks]] 😅
> 
> After doing a lesson, I recommend you answer the questions and complete the action items in here. For questions, you can just answer directly below.

# [[Module - Learn Obsidian]]
## [[Obsidian Markdown]]

> [!question] 
> What is your syntax philosophy? Does it conflict with any of mine?
> 
> List out the different syntax you commonly use. For each one, clarify what the meaning of the syntax is, and write this meaning in [[Obsidian Markdown]] so you can refer to it as part of your note-taking philosophy.

## [[Organization methods in Obsidian]]

> [!question] 
> How are you used to organizing your notes? Do you already follow similar principles on the usage of folders, links, and tags?

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Make it a habit to leverage the extra dimension of text by adding context to your links  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Metadata]]

> [!question] 
> What metadata do you already use in your notes? Are there any other ones you feel are important including in addition to the ones I suggested?
> 

## [[Obsidian Layout]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Visit each pane just for a quick glance to see what you can view  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] Move them around to your liking. If you end up moving them around, remember to also update the notes in [[Obsidian Layout]], sharing why you decided to do so  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Creating and modifying notes]]

> [!todo] 
> Practice:
> - [x] Open a note on the current tab  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] Open a note into a new tab  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] Open a new note into a new view and tab  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Obsidian Commands]]

> - [x] Use the command palette hotkey (Cmd/Ctrl+p) to run `Open command palette` 🤣 Do this as many times as you are tired of it and remember to open command palette when you want to try and run an action.  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] If you feel any of the panes from [[Obsidian Layout]] will be something you frequently view, consider thinking of a hotkey you can add for it  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[My Plugins]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Read the summaries of each plugin so you have a rough understanding on what you might need to use in the future when creating your own workflows  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] If you have any plugins you have used previously, now could be a good time to start implementing them into the vault  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Managing appearance and theme]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] If you want, experiment with different color schemes for the vault by going to `Minimal Theme Settings` settings  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> - [x] Make custom color changes with the `Style Settings Plugin` settings  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Obsidian Templates]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Insert one of [[My Addons]] into this note by running the `Open Insert Template Modal` command, typing "addon", then selecting one. Undo it after you are done.  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Dataview Plugin]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Let's get some practice! Type out your own Dataview query below based on the following criteria:  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
> 	- It should show a table with one of the columns as the `Description` of the note
> 	- Only show notes that have the tag `#plugin`
> 	- Sort it by ascending file name
> 	- If you need the solution, visit [[Obsidian Community Plugins#Dedicated Notes]]

## [[QuickAdd Plugin]]

> [!todo] 
> - [x] Create a new note using the QuickAdd command  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

## [[Obsidian Features]]

> [!question]
> Are there any other additional features you enjoy?

## [[AI in Obsidian]]

> [!question]
> How much do you value your privacy and data? Depending on that answer will help you determine whether to use private (LLMs) or public models (OpenAI)
> 
> I personally feel that if I don't have any sensitive data in my vault (or if it is excluded from being accessed from these LLMs by excluding the folder), then I'm okay with making the tradeoff of using public ones for their functionality
