## Summary
An overview of her input and knowledge management process
## Notes
> Useful notes are messy, and time is valuable. A sense of completionism is nice for some things but mostly just gets in the way when it comes to learning. I read about 10% of the articles that show up in my feed. I take highlight about 50% of those, and affirmatively take notes on about 10% of those. This doesn't mean I wasted my time reading, or that I failed at notetaking because I should have done a better job of taking comprehensive notes. It means I used judgment, and used my time wisely, and focused on things that were worthwhile from a return on investment perspective.

#### What kind of inputs do we consume?
- For pleasure
	- Fiction
- Solving a problem
	- Note making, for a project
- Serendipity
	- When away from desk and we have time to kill, for exploration

#### What to do with incoming things
- Add to pre-existing note
	- Logs and Indexes
		- Store resources/links until you finally need to use it, to which you can easily search
	- Claim / Evidence / Explanation
		- Claim is title
		- Leave breadcrumb to main source by copying a quote, easy retrieval
- Create a new note
	- Source notes
		- For each quote, have a header that includes annotation/summary of the quote
			- Treat quotes as evidence for a claim
			- Only turn into own note if you want to expand on it
			- Keep original format of book notes to make them shareable
		- When you want to reference, just link to the header/block
	- Claim notes into a note
- Send to readwise to indirectly deal with it
	- Automatically imports into Obsidian
		- Review highlights
			- Make sure annotations are still valid
			- Linked with relevant notes

### Ideas
#### You shouldn't paraphrase everything
- Give people a chance to explore the sources themselves

#### no concrete way to highlight
- just keep iterating on your own systems
- Reflect on your highlights after you read an article and iterate
### Actionable
- QuickAdd + JavaScript macro to turn all headings into new notes
