Use your mind

- Have a routine to expend less mental energy
- Start with a mini walk to practice setting intention

## Highlights

I pick up gold nuggets here and there from what I am consuming, but the real magic happens when I hear the right word that triggers a waterfall of insight. I’m not sure what the phenomenon is, but **sometimes you just need that one word, letter, sound, example, anecdote, or story to ==bring up a thought== that leads you down ==a rabbit hole of questioning and exploration**==.

Listening On A Walk

==II.I. Fill Your Mind==

**Reading In The Sun**

you **become less prone to familiar distractions** that will impact your study just by being in that environment

**Reading** — as opposed to listening — allows me **focus my attention and study deeper**. I can highlight ideas that I want to contemplate over the coming weeks and months for the sake of understanding

==II.II. Empty Your Mind==

A few ways you can practice immersing yourself in the present moment:

**The Gym**

Observe the voice in your head that tells you to quit. Observe how the muscle feels as it contracts. Observe the blood flowing quicker through your body.

**Nature Bathing**

You may have a water intake goal, distance goal, health goal, or just the goal to have a good time in nature. Intention.

Other **Meditative Habits** You Can Adopt

I **choose a topic that I know and fill in the blanks** in a way that I understand it according to my direct experience. **Stream of consciousness, then edit**. If you can’t tap into an infinite stream of consciousness, question why.

Physical Mediums

**brain dump journaling**

**By taking your attention off work and placing it on life, the gap between the two dissipates** and The Unknown will deliver the insight you were looking for to the forefront of your conscious mind.

==II.III. Use Your Mind==

There are 3 main things that come into play when **getting into deep, focused work**:

**Leveraged familiarity
Ordered consciousness
Connection to The Unknown**

Leveraged familiarity is a soft morning routine

I **start my mornings with a long 45-minute walk without my phone. I focus on my breath, body, and other sensations** that I bring my attention to. My intention with this is to ground myself in ‘not knowing’ before it’s time to work.
