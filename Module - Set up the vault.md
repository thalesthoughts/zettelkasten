## Sections 
To use the vault to its full potential, I recommend setting it up in the order I shared below:

    - Declare a yearly theme
    - Plan [[Wheel of life]] ratings and the associated [[12-Month Celebration]]
    - Create yearly goals in [[My Goals]]

### Personal Knowledge Management 
#### Sources 
Set up your capturing method:
- [x] Check out [Fleeting Notes App](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/fleeting-notes-app) and [Readwise Reader](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/readwise-reader)  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
- [x] What information are you keen to capture in your Obsidian vault?  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
- [x] Do either of these apps resonate with your information capture needs?  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
- [x] If so, watch the accompanying video for the app to learn my workflow and start setting it up based on the instructions  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
- [x] With the app you chose, do a test run! Collect highlights and insights and make sure it properly gets synced to your Obsidian vault  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

Organize your inputs:
- [x] Add any courses or series you are learning from in [My Input Collections](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Inputs/My+Input+Collections/My+Input+Collections)  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
#### Organize

- [x] Create any additional note types you need by following the process in [Create a new note type](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Create+a+new+note+type)  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

- [x] When you start to have more notes, follow the appropriate `Approach` outlined in [USV Module - Learn vault systems and workflows](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/USV%20Module%20-%20Learn%20vault%20systems%20and%20workflows)  [completion:: 2026-01-19]

#### Result 
- [x] Create new [Note types](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Note%20types) for [My Outputs](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/My+Outputs/My+Outputs) beyond just brainstorms to help you streamline your creation process. Examples include:  [completion:: 2026-01-19]
