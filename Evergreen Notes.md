## Why 

[[Compound knowledge with conceptual notes]]

[[Notes allow for multi-layer time travel]]

Allows for [[Bottom-Up Thinking]], letting new ideas emerge from our curiosities.

## What 

Evergreen are [[Conceptual notes]] consisting of [[atomic-sized, independent ideas]] that are then [[connected with related ideas]].

As the name evergreen suggests, they are continually revisited and refined as we come across more information in the resources we consume.

They can come in [[various forms]] to act as building blocks for the overall structure of our thought navigation.

They are a type of idea-based note, which you can learn more about in [[Note types]]

## How 

Notes with a specific status can be seen in [[My Greenhouse]].

### Creation 

I usually just use the quick switcher and type the name of the note, then press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to create it.

Then I set `Links` to a higher-order note, and start [[Note-making]] 😎

For other notes in [[USV Glossary]], you will need to use [[QuickAdd Plugin]] to create them.

### Metadata 

#### Status 

##### Seedlings 

🌱

- For ideas that you just want to record, then grow later
- I just create the note title, and then set the status to 🌱
- This is what I would consider to be [[Fleeting Notes]]
- Once you start growing the idea, it [[Sprouts]]

##### Sprouts 

🌿

- Sprouting ideas that you are still in the process of growing and nurturing
    - Can range from a few jot notes to an overall structure, but the thing is, you still feel like they are not ready to be part of the rest of the [[Trees]]. They need a bit more nurturing, whether it be by [[Making connections between notes]] or doing more [[Research]]
    - With sprouts, there is no rigid method for developing them as it is based on what you intuitively want to grow the note into, but if you want a more structured place to think, you can consider [[Brainstorms]]

##### Trees 

🌲

- Trees are notes mature enough to be part of your forest:
    - Already has connections with related notes
    - Contents of the note satisfy the title
- These are evergreen, meaning they continue to grow as you find more insights from [[Content consumption]] or form more connections
- I personally don't follow this though. Instead I'm playing around with using it to mostly highlight the unique evergreen ideas in my vault

Understand the different statuses when [[Managing and growing evergreen notes]] in the vault.
