### Review
I'm blown away by the powerful mix of productivity and inspiration.

Being a creator in the PKM system myself, I've always wanted to spread the message of how influential a personal knowledge management system is. Tiago's deeply rooted understanding and belief in the field has rekindled my passion for my second brain.

Building a second brain really is an effective antidote to the business and overwhelm of the current world, and I don't think there could be a more all-encompassing book on the subject. Out of the hundreds of resources I've consumed on knowledge and personal productivity, nothing has been as actionable and insightful as Forte's words.

If someone were to ask me how I'm able to live such a fulfilling life, this would be my go to response.

He has distilled the most valuable essence of PKM into simple steps and mindsets to help anyone at any stage. This book single-handedly empowers people to live more rich and fulfilling lives through meaningful self-awareness and self-expression.

Thank you for spreading awareness for PKM, I'm looking forward to it becoming mainstream because of your thought leadership.
