> [!info] [[My Values]]
## Principles
- This was a workbook recommended by my friend to understand the three kinds of values you have:
    - Identity values
    - Character values
    - Activity values

### Process 
- You look at a list of words, and slowly narrow down your selections into a select few
- Used to help know your values during important decisions you are trying to make
- If you're interested, you can also try it for yourself [here](https://www.dphillips.com/the-values-game)
