A Growth Mindset is the belief that we can improve, learn, and evolve through effort and curiosity. It assumes that everyone has the capacity for [[Self-Actualization]].

It is rooted in openness to learning, feedback, and change. Challenges are seen as opportunities for growth rather than threats.

There is a growth-oriented core within each of us that contains openness, love, and meaning. This core is often constrained by fear, anxiety, and limited perception.

The body and brain naturally adapt in response to challenge. This adaptive capacity outweighs initial genetic advantages. From the perspective of [[Rationality]], a growth mindset values the journey before the destination. It emphasizes process, effort, and leaning over outcomes.

Play and experimentation support growth. Oscar Wilde suggested that some things, like art, are too important to be taken seriously. Setting the bar low at the start allows exploration without attachment to results.

A growth mindset is grounded in [[Self-Love]]. We are already worthy as we are. Growth comes from valuing becoming rather than proving.
