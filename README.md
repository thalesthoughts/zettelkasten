# Zettelkasten
A Zettelkasten is a note-taking system built around small, densely interlinked notes, designed to serve as an external memory and writing aid. Though typically private, some are shared publicly as part of a website. The term is German for “slip box.” Zettelkästen often use tags and categories for organization, along with citations and references to attribute ideas to original sources.

A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It features hypertextual elements to facilitate a web of thoughts. Unlike other systems, it emphasizes connection over collection and encourages building a web of thoughts rather than accumulating isolated notes.

While online Zettelkästen may have many user interface features in common with their intellectual history antecedents, the commonplace book or related forms like wikis and digital gardens, their form and function are subtly different.

This particular system is a second brain developed in Obsidian MD to manage the ever-expanding digital landscape of information, distractions, and more. This system serves as a digital Wikipedia, second brain, or personal knowledge management system.
