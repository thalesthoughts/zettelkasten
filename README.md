# Zettelkasten
A Zettelkasten is a note-taking system built around small, densely interlinked notes, designed to serve as an external memory and writing aid. The term is German for “slip box.” Zettelkästen often use tags and categories for organization, along with citations and references to attribute ideas to original sources.
